# nf-gwas
**nf-gwas** is a Nextflow pipeline to run genome-wide association studies (GWAS) analysis. The pipeline automatically performs numerous pre- and post-processing steps, integrates regression modeling from the REGENIE package and currently supports single-variant, gene-based and interaction testing. All modules are structured in sub-workflows which allows to extend the pipeline to other methods and tools in future. nf-gwas includes an extensive reporting functionality that allows to inspect thousands of phenotypes and navigate interactive Manhattan plots directly in the web browser. .
